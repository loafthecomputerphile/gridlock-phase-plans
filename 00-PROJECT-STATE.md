# 00 — PROJECT STATE (anti-drift anchor)

**This file is the single source of truth for intent, decisions, and history. Every phase READS this file first and WRITES a changelog entry before it finishes. Dual location: this copy (plans home) is canonical; a synced copy lives at `hackathon\gridlock\docs\PROJECT-STATE.md` after each phase ends. On conflict: this copy wins → halt and ask the user.**

## 1. Original Intent (LOCKED — amend only by asking the user)

> "the data is out now. look in this folder. update the report using this folder as the main data source. `C:\Users\drewq\Documents\code\hackathon\research\Sperry-Tech-Challenge` use the other ones found if you want. so use this, the md file just made and the data found in your last run to make a folder with detailed numbered phase plans to give to claude code to complete this challenge. we will be using UI Example 3. the challege organisers want us to integrate AI. SPerry tech uses ai for the software they make for their parent construction company so we NEED that in there. look up what types of AI Sperry Tech uses and what AI can do for us here and ask questions suggesting models we use and and where to integrate them. with these plans you should place them 1 dir up. use nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill for the UI when yiu get to that. also for this: 'but many features are effectively straight-line corridor sketches, and existing ≠ planned: no base layer shows the future projects; only the PDF lists do.' can we just create our own layer if we have some sort of geo location still. ask us a lot of questions when making this plan and force phases to ask us questions too. make each phase update a central MD file and refer to that after each major update so each phase know what has happened in the past and what to do to still adhere to our intent if we kinda veered off trach for some reason"

**Deliverable of the planning session (done):** reconciled report `research\gridlock-evaluation.md` + this phase-plans folder. **Deliverable of the build (this folder drives):** the Gridlock app in `hackathon\gridlock\` completing phases 01–05, stretch 06.

**If you feel the build veering off track: STOP, re-read §1, and ask the user. Do not self-correct by inventing new direction.**

## 2. Locked Decisions (49 — do NOT re-ask; ask only what a phase's START-GATE lists)

### Logistics & governance
- Plans live at `hackathon\phase-plans\` (one dir up from `research\`); app repo at `hackathon\gridlock\`.
- Deadline: **under 24 hours** → relative clock **T+0..24h** (T+0 = build kickoff; budgets per phase below).
- One session, sequential phases, solo (subagents only for isolated read-only lookups).
- Git: single branch `main`; **commit per phase**; commit messages end `Co-Authored-By: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- State file dual-location: this home file = source of truth; copy to `gridlock\docs\PROJECT-STATE.md` at each phase end (sync rule §5).
- Release data copied into `gridlock\data\release\` (folder = ground truth for the build).
- Question cadence: **2–4 AskUserQuestion items at every phase open** (START-GATE), plus ask again before any irreversible/direction-setting choice. Mechanical fixes may proceed with a changelog note; **intent-level drift → halt and ask**.
- Original Intent is locked (§1); amendments only by asking the user.

### Data & scoring
- **Folder is ground truth**: `research\Sperry-Tech-Challenge\` — 6 files (outline DOCX, Finding_Real_Locations_Guide DOCX, Projects_Overlaps.xlsx, Dominion 2024–2028 PDF [44 pp], Georgia Power 2025 IRP Vol.3 PDF [668 pp], Sperry intern listing DOCX).
- Canonical scoring (byte-identical wording everywhere): "score = tier points (crossing=100, <1.6 km=60, <8 km=40, <40 km=20) + 15 if build windows overlap, total capped at 100; tie-break by smaller closest-point distance". Build window = `[in-service year, in-service year + 1]`. All distance math in **EPSG:5070**.
- Time gap: **scored by year** (window rule above); **displayed as days** via `time_gap` = |in_service_date_a − in_service_date_b| in days (release guide + starter workbook semantics — absolute date difference, exact integers).
- Release guide method (ground truth for the golden fixture): project **center point = midpoint of its two named sub-points; if only one point is located, that point is the center**; overlap = **center-to-center haversine < 25 mi (40,234 m)**; every match confirmed against the PDF description/zone or flagged lower-confidence.
- GPC scope: **GPC-sponsored rows only** (ITS Table 2 Sponsor column ≈ 122 rows).
- Own layer: **straight corridors** — geocoded endpoints → LineString/Point GeoJSON, our own styled layer (snap-to-existing = stretch only).
- Geocode QA: automated pass + **per-endpoint confidence labels** (confirmed / likely / unconfirmed) + manual second look.
- Freshness: release data is the build's data; **live cross-check spot** (a few sources re-fetched) noted in README.
- Golden test: **reproduce the starter workbook's 6 overlap rows, ±0.1 mi, via center-point haversine** (exact expected values embedded in phase 02). Starter export schema (`Projects_Overlaps.xlsx`) is preserved for CSV export.
- Table rows: **top 10 visible; excluded >40 km greyed below** (expandable); **CSV exports all** rows.
- Basemap: **light only**. Palette binding (exact): DESC `#2563EB`, GPC `#059669`, halos — touching `#DC2626`, <1.6 km `#F97316`, <8 km `#FBBF24`, <40 km `#FDE68A`, excluded grey at 20% opacity.

### Stack
- Backend: **Python / FastAPI** + geopandas, shapely, pdfplumber, geopy, pandas, pyproj — env via **uv**.
- Frontend: **Vite / React / TypeScript**, TanStack Table, MapLibre GL, Zustand, Tailwind — via **npm**.
- Serving: **single-port FastAPI** serves the built static frontend. Demo: **offline-first static**, **local only**.
- Testing: **smoke self-checks** (assert-style scripts; no heavy test framework).
- UI: **UI Example 3 = Concept C "Ledger"** (sortable ranked table primary surface + sticky linked map inset). UI built with skill `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill`, **building around the report palette above** (skill styles, palette governs hues).

### AI
- **Free-tier only** → OpenRouter with a **provider adapter** (others swappable later).
- Pinned primary model: **`meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free`**, **fallback-on-error** to a secondary free model in the adapter.
- Features: **(1) pair-brief generator** — planner-prose, 3–4 sentences, numbers injected from the pair data; **(2) natural-language table query** — filter/sort/count ONLY (never writes, never answers free-form knowledge).
- Caching: **disk JSON cache + live fallback** (cache key includes model + prompt version).
- UX: **status chip + graceful fallback** — states: live / cached / rate-limited / unavailable + Retry; NL query falls back to a local keyword filter when AI is down. Placement: **command bar** (NL query) + **detail drawer** (pair briefs).
- Sperry Tech AI ("software · engineering · research"; construction-company parent → ETL/validation/ML over messy project data): **pitch + README framing only**, not a runtime dependency.
- Ship floor: **map + table + 1 AI feature (pair briefs)** ship; NL query + exports next; **pitch and bonus cost/impact are cut first** → stretch phase 06.

### Report reconciliation (completed this session)
- Full reconciliation of `research\gridlock-evaluation.md`; all source rows **kept with statuses refreshed**; UI section keeps the Concept A analysis and appends the **locked-choice-C** note.

## 3. Phase Tracker

| # | File | T+ budget | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 01 | 01-FOUNDATION.md | T+0–2h | not started |
| 02 | 02-DATA-PIPELINE.md | T+2–8h | not started |
| 03 | 03-SCORING-API.md | T+8–12h | not started |
| 04 | 04-FRONTEND.md | T+12–19h | not started |
| 05 | 05-AI-SHIP.md | T+19–23h | not started |
| 06 | 06-STRETCH.md (stretch, cut-first items) | T+23–24h+ | not started |

Ship floor = end of phase 05 with pair briefs working. If the clock runs out mid-phase: finish the phase's Verify minimum, write the changelog, stop — do not start the next phase.

---

## 4. Changelog (append-only; newest last; stamp with T+ time)

| T+ | Phase | What changed | Why / who decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| T−0 | planning | Report fully reconciled vs release folder; phase plans authored (this folder) | User-approved plan; 49 locked decisions |

---

## 5. Sync Protocol (dual location)

1. This file (`phase-plans\00-PROJECT-STATE.md`) is canonical.
2. At each phase end: copy it to `gridlock\docs\PROJECT-STATE.md`, commit both the repo copy and the changelog entry with the phase commit.
3. Before starting a phase: read THIS file, not the repo copy.
4. Conflict (copies differ beyond the expected changelog tail): home wins → halt and ask the user.

---

## 6. Open Questions log

Record every START-GATE answer and mid-phase fork here as they happen (append rows):

| T+ | Phase | Question | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | — | (none yet) | — |

---

## 7. The phase-file pattern (every phase file follows this)

Each numbered file contains, in order:

1. **Header** — mission, T+ budget, inputs (specific report sections + specific release files under `research\Sperry-Tech-Challenge\` and `gridlock\data\release\`).
2. **START-GATE** — 2–4 real AskUserQuestion items. **The user must answer before any task runs.** Never re-ask anything in §2.
3. **Tasks** — checklist with exact paths under `hackathon\gridlock\`; critical schemas/formulas/URLs/palette values embedded inline (no need to open the report mid-build).
4. **Verify** — phase-specific smoke self-checks / golden tests; the phase does not exit red.
5. **STATE UPDATE** — re-read `00-PROJECT-STATE.md`; append its §4 changelog row; log START-GATE answers in its §6; sync the file to `gridlock\docs\`.
6. **Halt rule** — intent-level drift → stop and ask. Mechanical fixes → proceed + changelog note.
